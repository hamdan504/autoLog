# Logger2139

Logger2139 is a Flask-based web application that automates the login process and navigation actions on the 2139 Exchange platform. The application uses Selenium to fill in login credentials, navigate to specific pages, and execute actions such as confirming transactions.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic use of Flask integrated with Selenium WebDriver to automate web interactions. The app automates the login process on the 2139 Exchange platform, navigates to a specific transaction page, and attempts to confirm a transaction.

## How to Run the Project
